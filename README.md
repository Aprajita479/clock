# Theme Clock

A simple theme clock web application inspired by a [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/5958443-Alarm-clock). The clock displays the current time and date and allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Preview

Include a preview image or GIF of the clock in action.

## Installation

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Click the "Dark mode" button to toggle between light and dark themes.

The clock shows the current time, including hours, minutes, and AM/PM indicator. It also displays the current date with the day of the week and month.
